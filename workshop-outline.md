# Workshop outline

We'll all be working on our own stuff, but this isn't a blame game. It's a "how can we make our stuff better for everyone?"" game. It's a love-in. :)

## Warm-up questions

* Who does accessibility help?
* Who will you share the stuff from the workshop with? (tie this in to SMART goal at end)

### Alternatives

* What do you already know about accessibility?
* Is accessibility easy or hard?
* When is the best time to consider accessibility in a project?
* Who do you know that would benefit from web sites being more accessible?
* What accessibility features would you benefit from?

## Opening activity (as people arrive)

* Share your warm-up answers with your table.
* Another activity.
  * When might accessibility features be useful to a person? (e.g. injury, dark room. Have examples ready for them to pick from?)
  * Need to highlight that the barrier part of accessibility means other things like language, environment. Get attendees to make this list. Use personas as jumping off point / helper? In intro lightning talk?

## Two lightning talks (2 x 5m)

* what topics?
* one on theory, one on practical?

## Tour the personas (20m)

* Look at the [Equations](print-for-wall/equations.pdf)
* Use the [personas from A Web For Everyone](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/a-web-for-everyone/personas-for-accessible-ux/).
* Walk around posters of personas on walls. People can add notes to posters (this needs guidance. what notes? "I know someone like this?" Highlight most important part for you? Get them to fill in some blanks, like Ability, Aptitude,  Attitude?)
* Attendees pick a few to focus on. Stacks of print-outs for people to take back to the tables.

## GAAD activities (30m + 5m)

* Grab a copy of the [Global Accessibility Awareness Day activities handout](activities.md).
* As a table, split up the activities between yourselves. Try and make sure that you cover all the activities.
* Do a 5 minute review at the end. What was the most important thing you learned.

## Make a checklist (30m)

* Review the wall posters: Accessible User Experience Framework and Universal Design Principles.
* Grab two different colour pens: one for FED and one for UX.
* Go through A Web For Everyone's [APPENDIX A: Accessible UX Principles and Guidelines](handout/AWFE-AppendixA1.pdf).  Mark with a tick items that are FED and items that are UX-related.
* Pick the four most important items and write them down on sticky notes. Pick three for FED and one for UX.
* As a table, write down some ideas for how to make these things happen. It could be a tool or a process change.

## Find things to improve in your stuff (60m)

* Consult the your checklist and our [resources pages](resources.md).
* Make yourself a TODO list. Pick three things to work on today.

## GAAD Activities at your office (10m)

* Discuss and write down ways to get others at the office to do these on WGAAD.
  * What's the value?
  * Who does it affect?
* Follow-ups: blog post, tweets, share on meetup, Slacks.

## Facilitator Feedback (5m)

* On an index card, write down **one thing we could do differently next time**.
