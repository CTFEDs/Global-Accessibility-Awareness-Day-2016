# Workshop outline

We'll all be working on our own stuff, but this isn't a blame game. It's a "how can we make our stuff better for everyone?"" game. It's a love-in. :)

## Warm-up questions

* Who does accessibility help?
* Who will you share the stuff from the workshop with? (tie this in to SMART goal at end)

## Opening activity (as people arrive)

* Share your warm-up answers with your table.
* Review the list of categories of "disabilities" on the wall. Pick a tick in the column if you know someone who falls into this category.

## Two lightning talks (2 x 5m)

* WAI-ARIA whistlestop tour, landmarks, roles, etc. WCAG levels.
* Inclusive design, universal design. What are the bad things that happen when you don't design and code accessibly? Show some sites without images, in Lynx.
* Demonstration of VoiceOver, Lynx (as proxy)
* 5Ws and 1H of Accessbility. Shout outs from audience, but with one in speaker notes?

## Tour the personas (20m)

* Use the [personas from A Web For Everyone](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/a-web-for-everyone/personas-for-accessible-ux/).
* Justin and Steve talk through the [Equations](print-for-wall/equations.pdf)
* Walk around and read the posters of personas on walls.
* Pick a few to focus on. Take a print-out of each. We'll use them later.

## GAAD activities (30m + 5m)

* Grab a copy of the [Global Accessibility Awareness Day activities handout](activities.md).
* As a table, split up the activities between yourselves. Try and make sure that you cover all the activities.
* Do a 5 minute review with your table at the end. What was the most important thing you learned?

## Make a checklist (30m)

* Justin and Steve talk through the wall posters: Universal Design Principles, WCAG POUR framework, and Accessible User Experience Framework.
* Grab two different colour pens: one for FED and one for UX.
* Go through A Web For Everyone's [APPENDIX A: Accessible UX Principles and Guidelines](handout/AWFE-AppendixA1.pdf).  Mark with a tick items that are FED and items that are UX-related.
* Pick the four most important items and write them down on sticky notes. Make sure you pick a mix of FED and UX things.
* As a table, write down some ideas for how to make these things happen. It could be a tool, a process change, a bit of code, a design pattern.

## Find things to improve in your stuff (60m)

* Consult the your checklist and our [resources pages](resources.md).
* Make yourself a TODO list. Pick three things to work on today.

## GAAD Activities at your office (10m)

* Discuss and write down ways to get others at the office to do these on WGAAD.
  * What's the value?
  * Who does it affect?
* Follow-ups: blog post, tweets, share on meetup, Slacks.

## Facilitator Feedback (5m)

* On an index card, write down **one thing we could do differently next time**.
