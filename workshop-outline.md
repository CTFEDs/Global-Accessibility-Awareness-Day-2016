# Workshop outline

We'll all be working on our own stuff, but this isn't a blame game. It's a "how can we make our stuff better for everyone?"" game. It's a love-in. :)

## Warm-up questions

* Who does accessibility help?
* Who will you share the stuff from the workshop with? (tie this in to SMART goal at end)

## Opening activity (as people arrive)

* Share your warm-up answers with your table.
* Review the list of categories of **barriers to access** on the wall. Pick a tick in the column if you know someone who falls into this category.

## Two lightning talks (2 x 10m)

* **Steve**. 5Ws and 1H of Accessibility. Shout outs from audience, but with one in speaker notes?
* **Justin**. WAI-ARIA whistle-stop tour, landmarks, roles, etc. WCAG levels.

## Write down ideas to make them happen (10m)
