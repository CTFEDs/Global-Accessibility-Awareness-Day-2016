# Introduction

Ideas for warm-up questions.

* What do you already know about accessibility?
* Who does accessibility help?
* Is accessibility easy or hard?
* When is the best time to consider accessibility in a project?

Other start-up activity ideas.

* When might accessibility features be useful to a person? (e.g. injury, dark room. Have examples ready for them to pick from?)
* introduce some [personas](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/a-web-for-everyone/personas-for-accessible-ux/)?

## Two lightning talks

* what topics?
* one on theory, one on practical?

# Your stuff

## Checklist

* [Validate](http://validator.w3.org/) your HTML.
* Use HTML5 input types like `search`, `email`, and `date`.
* Use HTML5 elements like `section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`, and `nav`.* Make sure every image has `alt` text.
* Use the `picture` element and `srcset` to provide the image most suitable for the user's device. You can use [Picturefill](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) to enable support for `picture` in browsers that don't support it yet.

## Examples to work through

* Heydon Pickering's [practical ARIA examples](http://heydonworks.com/practical_aria_examples/)
* Font Awesome 4.6 Released: [Making accessibility more accessible](https://articles.fortawesome.com/font-awesome-4-6-released-d7213342698a#.j8om7wij4)
* [Code Library (Beta) from Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/)

# Other people's stuff

* How to convice your boss. Handout?
* Activity list. Handout?
* Follow-ups: blog post, tweets, share on meetup, Slacks.
